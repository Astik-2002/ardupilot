    where M is the number of coefficients per segment and is equal to (order)*2. If one 
    desires to create a minimum velocity, order = 1. Minimum snap would be order = 4. 

    1.The Problem
    Generate a full trajectory across N+1 waypoint is made of N polynomial line segment.
    Each segment is defined as a (2*order-1)-th order polynomial defined as follow:
    Minimum velocity:     Pi = ai_0 + ai1*t
    Minimum acceleration: Pi = ai_0 + ai1*t + ai2*t^2 + ai3*t^3
    Minimum jerk:         Pi = ai_0 + ai1*t + ai2*t^2 + ai3*t^3 + ai4*t^4 + ai5*t^5
    Minimum snap:         Pi = ai_0 + ai1*t + ai2*t^2 + ai3*t^3 + ai4*t^4 + ai5*t^5 + ai6*t^6 + ai7*t^7

    Each polynomial has M unknown coefficients, thus we will have M*N unknown to
    solve in total, so we need to come up with M*N constraints.

    2.The constraints
    In general, the constraints is a set of condition which define the initial
    and final state, continuity between each piecewise function. This includes
    specifying continuity in higher derivatives of the trajectory at the
    intermediate waypoints.

    3.Matrix Design
    Since we have M*N unknown coefficients to solve, and if we are given M*N
    equations(constraints), then the problem becomes solving a linear equation.

    A * Coeff = B

    Let's look at B matrix first, B matrix is simple because it is just some constants
    on the right hand side of the equation. There are M*N constraints,
    so B matrix will be [M*N, 1].

    Coeff is the final output matrix consists of M*N elements. 
    Since B matrix is only one column, Coeff matrix must be [M*N, 1].

    A matrix is tricky, we then can think of A matrix as a coeffient-coeffient matrix.
    We are no longer looking at a particular polynomial Pi, but rather P1, P2...PN
    as a whole. Since now our Coeff matrix is [M*N, 1], and B is [M*N, 1], thus
    A matrix must have the form [M*N, M*N].

    A = [A10 A11 ... A1M A20 A21 ... A2M ... AN0 AN1 ... ANM
        ...
        ]

    Each element in a row represents the coefficient of coeffient aij under
    a certain constraint, where aij is the jth coeffient of Pi with i = 1...N, j = 0...(M-1).
